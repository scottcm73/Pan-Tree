Home Inventory App Project


Our group includes Scott McMahan, Cesar Tolentino, Derrick Butler, and Memet Bulut. The goal of our project is to offer an online app with a MySQL database backend that will allow users to keep an inventory of what they have in their pantry and their refrigerators. 

As part of the user experience, the app will provide a dynamic dashboard that utilizes Flask and a graphing package to provide an interactive and visualized glimpse into what the user has in the pantry and what they have purchased previously.

We will seed the database with data from Instacart about the purchases of over 60,000 customers. We will provide numerous graphs of expenditures over time, favorite products, budgeting, perhaps purchase suggestions, etc.

The app will also give users the option to discard or throw-out the item when it is gone. Users will be able to choose which products to keep track of in inventory. Users will likely decide not to track long-life products such as cleaning products.

The data from Instacart already offers numerous product categories that users can keep track of and show their expenditures and budgeting.

While such an app would ultimately let users make purchases, we may or may not get to this point in this project. We may choose to use the data from Instacart and make the dashboard from that data.

Ultimately, such an app would make buying recommendations so users could choose to have an abundance of a product like toilet paper and ensure that they never run out, or to have an almost constant supply that rarely runs out except towards the end of the week. Other products could be one-of or occasional indulgences. Users could also theoretically set product levels to have the product at home at least half of or 75% of the time.

Again, we may choose to concentrate on the dashboard for now.
